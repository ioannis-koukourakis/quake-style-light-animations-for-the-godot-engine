# Quake-Style Light Animations for Godot  

A modular, component-based system for creating animated lights in the Godot engine, inspired by the dynamic light animations of classic Quake and Half-Life games.  

Please note: This addon is provided as-is. While there won't be official support, I will be updating it as I continue work on my own project.
